        "As neural networks are a pillar in both the early and the recent advances of artificial intelligence, their use for credit card fraud detection is not surprising. The first examples of simple feed-forward neural networks applied to fraud detection can bring us back to the early 90s {cite}`ghosh1994credit,aleskerov1997cardwatch`. Naturally, in recent FDS studies, neural networks are often found in experimental benchmarks, along with random forests, XGBoost, or logistic regression.\n",

[Dataset](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html?highlight=dataset#torch.utils.data.Dataset) is the interface to access the data. Given a sample's index, it provides a well-formed input-output for the model. [Dataloader](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html?highlight=dataloader#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) takes the Dataset as input and provides an iterator for the training loop. It also allows to create batches, shuffle data, and parallelize data preparation.\n",

It has an init function in which it instantiates all the necessary submodules (layers) and initializes their weights. It also has a forward function that defines all the operations of the forward pass.\n",
        "* The optimizer: The [optimizer](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html) is the object that implements the optimization algorithm. It is called after the loss is computed to calculate the necessary model updates. The most basic one is SGD, but there are many others like RMSProp, Adagrad, Adam, ...\n",
        "* Training loop and evaluation: the training loop is the core of a model's training. It consists in performing several iterations (epochs), getting all the training batches from the loader, performing the forward pass, computing the loss, and calling the optimizer. After each epoch, an evaluation can be performed to track the model's evolution and possibly stop the process.\n",

        "Note: This first custom Dataset `FraudDataset` seems useless because its role is very limited (simply returning a row from x and y) and because the matrices x and y are already loaded in RAM. This example is provided for educational purposes. But the concept of Dataset has a high interest when sample preparation requires more preprocessing. For instance, it becomes very handy for sequence preparation when using recurrent models (like an LSTM). This will be covered more in-depth later in this chapter but for example, a Dataset for sequential models performs several operations before returning a sample: searching for the history of transactions of the same cardholder and appending it to the current transaction before returning the whole sequence. It avoids preparing all the sequences in advance, which would entail repeating several transactions' features in memory and consuming more RAM than necessary. Datasets objects are also useful when dealing with large image datasets in order to load the images on the fly."

For now, let us consider a batch size of 64: this means that at each optimization step, 64 samples will be requested to the Dataset, turned into a batch, and go through the forward pass in parallel. Then the aggregation (sum or average) of the gradient of their losses will be used for backpropagation.\n",

A first layer `fc1` which takes as input as many neurons as there are features in the input x. It can be followed by a hidden layer with a chosen number of neurons (`hidden_size`). Finally comes the output layer which has a single output neuron to fit the label (`fraud` or `genuine`, represented by 1 and 0).\n",

Today, the preferred choice is `ReLU` (or variants like `eLU`, `leaky ReLU`), at least for the intermediate neurons. It has empirically proven to be a better choice for optimization and speed {cite}`nair2010rectified`. For output neurons, the choice depends on the range or the expected distribution for the output value to be predicted.\n",

        "One can note here how the training loss decreases epoch after epoch. This means that the optimization is going well: the chosen learning rate allows to update the model towards a better solution (lower loss) for the **training dataset**. However, neural networks are known to be very expressive models. In fact, the universal approximation theorem shows that, with enough neurons/layers, one can model any function with a neural network {cite}`cybenko1989approximation`. Therefore, it is expected for a complex neural network to be able to fit almost perfectly the training data. But the ultimate goal is to obtain a model that generalizes well on unseen data (like the validation set). Looking at the validation loss, one can see that it starts by decreasing (with oscillations) and it reaches an optimum around 0.019, and stops decreasing (or even starts increasing). This phenomenon is referred to as [overfitting](Model_Selection).\n",
        "\n",
        "Many aspects can be improved in the training. Although one cannot measure the performance on the final test set while training, one can rely on a validation set and try to stop training before overfitting (see [](Model_Selection)). One can also change the optimization algorithm and parameters to speed up training and reach a better optimum. This is investigated later, in the optimization paragraph."

        "The most common technique to regularize a machine learning model is to restrict its parameter space, for instance, its norm, by adding a term in the optimization problem. Additionally, to minimize the discrepancy between ground truth and prediction, integrating an L1 norm (resp. L2 norm) term in the loss will entail parameter sparsity (resp. will limit parameters amplitude). The initial solution space is generally full of equivalent solutions (e.g. with linear activations, dividing all input weights of a neuron by 2 and multiplying all of its output weights by 2 leads to an equivalent model), so the restrictions entailed by regularization not only limits overfitting but also reduces the search and can help with optimization. Finally, selecting a solution with minimal norm follows the principle of \"All things being equal, the simplest solution tends to be the best one\", a scientific principle often referred to as the [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor).\n",

Dropout consists in randomly dropping some neurons from the network at each training step. More precisely, one fixes a dropout parameter p∈[0,1], and, for each mini-batch, for each neuron, performs a coin toss (Bernoulli) with probability p. If positive, one temporarily sets the neuron's weights to zero (so that the dropped neuron is not considered during the forward and backward passes). It is equivalent to training a random sub-network at each mini-batch (Figure 5), and it can be proven that this has an L2-regularization effect on specific architectures {cite}`srivastava2014dropout`.\n",

The first property can be easily implemented by applying min-max or standard scaling on the features. As for the second property, it depends on the original distribution of the features. Some of them are not normally distributed and have non-linear scales (e.g. amount): increasing the amount by 5 dollars should not have the same effect if the starting point is 5 dollars or if the starting point is 100 dollars.
